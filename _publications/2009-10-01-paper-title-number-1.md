title: "NEGATIVE WTI PRICE: WHAT REALLY HAPPENED AND WHAT
CAN WE LEARN?"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'The price of WTI futures contracts fell into the negative on April 20, 2020.
In this paper, I investigate underlying factors that contributed to the negative price and
propose rule changes. Regarding the causes, first, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and
an oil price war, an oil oversupply and storage shortage put huge downward pressure
on oil prices; second, CME group made policy changes in early April allowing negative
prices; third, heterogeneous trading activities of retail investors and speculators contributed to the negative price on April 20. To improve market efficiency and fairness for
market participants, I propose rule changes, such as more advance notice for market rule
changes, robust alternatives for settlement price construction, and appropriate limit on
TAS contracts.'
